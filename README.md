# Intrusion-Detection-System
A machine-learning-based IDS for real-time network threat detection using signature &amp; anomaly-based methods. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, it processes the UNSW_NB15 dataset, achieving 95.6% accuracy, 96.4% recall with Random Forest + RFE. Future work includes deep learning, hyperparameter tuning &amp; real-world deployment.
