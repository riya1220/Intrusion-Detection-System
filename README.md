# Intrusion-Detection-System for network traffic
This project detects cybersecurity threats in real-time using Machine Learning. It preprocesses network traffic data, selects important features using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and trains models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes to identify intrusions with high accuracy.

## Features
- Monitors network traffic for malicious activities
- Uses signature-based & anomaly-based detection
- Implements feature selection (RFE) for optimization
- Trains Decision Tree, Random Forest, and GaussianNB models
- Achieves high accuracy (95.6%) with low false positive rate

## Tech Stack
- Languages: Python
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Techniques: Machine Learning, Feature Engineering, Data Preprocessing

## Dataset
- Source: UNSW_NB15 Dataset
- Size: 257,673 records (Train: 175,341, Test: 82,332)
- Labels: "Benign" (Normal traffic) & "Attack" (Malicious traffic)

## Installation & Setup  
- Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riya1220/IDS-Project.git  
   cd IDS-Project
   ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Run the project:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```


## Results
- Accuracy: 95.6%
- Best Model: Random Forest + RFE
